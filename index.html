                <h2>Iceland Biome</h2>
                <p>
                    Iceland is located north of the Atlantic Ocean, and its northern boundary is in 
                    the south of the Arctic Circle. The main biome of Iceland is Tundra. In Iceland, 
                    the center is arctic desert, and most land of the country is covered by glaciers 
                    which are 12,000km². According to the statistic, 11.5% of the country is glaciers.
                    The average temperature is 6°C in summer, and the average winter temperature is 
                    about 0°C. So the average temperatures in summer and winter are both very low. 
                    However, the average highs in summer are 24°C and the average highs in winter is 
                    about 9°C. So there is a large difference between the average highs in summer and 
                    winter in Iceland. There is continuous daylight in two to three months in summer 
                    because its location is close to the Arctic. Precipitation is about 400 to 1,000 mm. 
                    The relatively mild climate is caused by the influence of the Gulf Stream. Iceland’s 
                    climate is very variable and unpredictable, which causes negative effects on the 
                    domestic habitat. High winds and precipitation make rapid erosion of soil and 
                    coastline since scarce vegetation.

                <p>
                    Iceland is a. volcanic island, which on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Many of the 
                    volcanoes are still active, including the well-known volcanoes Hekla, Katla, 
                    and Krafla. There is still a turbulent movement of saturated soil although 
                    soils are andosols and podzols. Iceland has the largest glacier in all of Europe, 
                    Vatnajökull. However, the warming climate is causing the melting of glaciers.

                    Bird diversity is very rich in Iceland. There are over three hundred 
                    species have been observed. 61 bird living areas cover 7% of the land. This 
                    habitat becomes an important refueling stop for many birds that migrate from 
                    Arctic breeding grounds to warmer wintering sites. There are 88 species have 
                    their ness regularly in Iceland. In these species, 42 kinds of species are under 
                    the protection of Europe. These include the Short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), Snowy 
                    owl (Nyctea scandiaca), Redshank (Tringa totanus), Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea), 
                    Cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo), Glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), Fulmar (Fulmarus 
                    glacialis), and Snow bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis).

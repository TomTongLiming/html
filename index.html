                    The island is located far north in the Atlantic Ocean with 
                    its northern edge situated just south of the Arctic Circle. 
                    The main biome of Iceland is Tundra. The interior of the country 
                    is largely arctic desert, and much of the interior of the country 
                    consists of glaciers, which cover almost 12,000km² or 11.5 percent 
                    of the country.Iceland has a relatively mild coastal climate due 
                    to the effect of the GulfThe average temperature is 6°C in July, 
                    with average highs of 24. The average winter temperature in Reykjavik 
                    is about 0°C in January (average highs are 9. 9°C). For two to 
                    three months in summer there is continuous daylight in Iceland, 
                    and early spring and late autumn enjoy long twilight. However, the 
                    days are very short in mid-winter. Precipitation ranges anywhere 
                    from 400 to 1,000 mm. The relatively mild climate is due to the 
                    influence of the Gulf Stream. Iceland has a very vigorous climate, 
                    which has a negative effect on the habitat; with little or no vegetation, 
                    high winds and precipitation lead to rapid erosion of soil and coastline.

                    This ecoregion is rich in bird diversity, over three hundred 
                    species have been observed. Sixty-one Important Bird Areas 
                    cover seven percent of this country. Although not technically 
                    an artcic area, many typical arctic species are found here. 
                    This habitat serves as an important refueling stop for many 
                    migratory birds from Arctic breeding grounds to warmer wintering 
                    sites. Eighty-eight species have, up to recently, been nesting 
                    regularly in the country. Of these, fourty-two species are of 
                    European conservation concern. These include the Short -eared 
                    owl (Asio flammeus), Snowy owl (Nyctea scandiaca), Redshank 
                    (Tringa totanus), Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea), Cormorant 
                    (Phalacrocorax carbo), Glaucous gull (Larus hyperboreus), 
                    Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), and Snow bunting (Plectrophenax 
                    nivalis). Thjorsarver, an Important Bird Area contains one of 
                    the largest breeding colony in the world for the Pink-footed 
                    goose (Anser brachyrhynchus) (Wheatley 2000).

            <h2>WHATLES</h2>
            <p>
                Iceland’s fertile sub-Arctic waters, fed by the Gulf Stream,
                are home to over twenty different species of whale and dolphin. 
                It is one of the best places in the world for whale-watching,
                especially during the summer when the great whales migrate here
                to feed. This industry is changing the way that Icelanders view
                the creatures of the deep, as the relationship between the two
                is historical and complex. As seafarers, many accounts from early
                Icelanders depict whales as terrible leviathans. While feared
                when in their natural environment, however, whales were hugely
                appreciated when they washed up on the beaches. The meat from a
                single stranding could feed communities, and their oil could
                supply candles and lanterns to help sustain people through the
                dark winters. The word for ‘windfall’ in Icelandic is the same
                as the word for a beached whale. <a href="reference.html"><i>[REFERENCE]</i></a>

            <h2>ARCTIC FOXES</h2>
            <p>
                Before human settlement, Arctic Foxes were the only land
                mammal that lived in Iceland. The Arctic Foxes in Iceland
                come in two colors morphs, white and blue. White foxes change
                their coat completely between seasons, going from snow-white
                in winter to a brown and white in summer. Blue foxes do not
                change coat, but their fur is bleached throughout summer so
                that they are much lighter by the arrival of winter. Both
                variants thicken their fur throughout the colder months,
                however, and lose it when the weather warms.Arctic Foxes can
                be found all across Iceland, but are especially concentrated
                in the West-fjords, most notably the remote Hornstrandir Reserve
                in the very north where they are protected. In this region,
                they are noted for being quite fearless of humans, so wildlife
                photographers often come for some very intimate shots.

            <h2>REINDEER</h2>
            <p>
                Reindeer were brought over to Iceland much later than the domestic
                animals, in the 18th Century. Initially, they were to be farmed as
                they were across Scandinavia, but Icelanders never took to the practice.
                The population, therefore, became wild.About 3,000 reindeer now live in
                the country, all concentrated in the east. They are most commonly
                found around Snæfell, on the higher ground throughout summer and in
                the warmer lowlands throughout winter, but have been seen as far
                south as Jökulsárlón and as far north as Vopnafjörður. Those driving
                through or staying in the East Fjords have a reasonable chance of
                spotting a herd.<a href="reference.html"><i>[REFERENCE]</i></a>

            <h2>LUPINE (LUPINUS NOOTKATENSIS)</h2>
            <p>
                There is no other plant in Iceland as controversial as the iconic Lupine.
                The perennial plant is native to North America and was introduced to Iceland
                in 1945 to tackle topsoil erosion. Since its arrival, the lupine has prospered
                and spread all over the country, sometimes in locations where it is not
                wholly welcome. In many areas, it poses a threat to a number of indigenous
                plants, including some moss species which are notoriously difficult to establish
                or recover. Worries about a lupine monoculture homogenising the natural flora
                of Iceland fuel anti-lupine sentiment but it has proven difficult to halt the
                proliferation of the species.Not everyone is against the lupine! Many take
                pleasure from the colour it has added to the Icelandic countryside and the
                pretty purple flowers provide ample photo opportunities for visitors and locals alike.

            <h2>DANDELION (TARAXACUM FAMILY)</h2>
            <p>
                Dandelions grow everywhere in Iceland and in huge abundance. These wildflowers
                are suited to disturbed soils which are common across Iceland.Although dandelions
                can be considered a family of wildflowers of which quite a few different species
                grow in Iceland, most Icelanders when referring to a dandelion would simply use the
                term 'Túnfífill' or simply 'Fífill'.Dandelions are rich in vitamins and minerals and
                the whole plant is edible from flower to root. They have therefore long featured in
                the Icelandic diet be it as a tea or tonic or by adding the leaves to salads. The
                root of the plant has long been used as an invaluable coffee substitute since coffee
                was expensive and often in short supply.

            <h2>DULSE (PALMARIA PALMATA)</h2>
            <p>
                The history of Iceland is deeply intertwined with the sea. Not only did the Viking
                settlers have to cross it to reach Iceland, but it has served as a critical source of
                food, not only for fish for a long while. It is a type of red seaweed which nourished
                Icelanders since the first settlers arrived. It was collected in vast quantities in
                the spring and summer, and then it was dried to stockpile or for trade. It could
                often be depended on as a reliable source of nutrition in winter.

            <h2>PUFFINS</h2>
            <p>
                No article on the birds of Iceland can really begin without a mention
                of the Atlantic Puffin. These adorable animals are elusive across the
                vast majority of their range, but not in Iceland; sixty percent of the
                twelve million or so individuals nest here, and from May to September,
                there are a wealth of places where they can be found with ease. As mentioned
                above, millions nest in the Látrabjarg birdwatching cliffs in the Westfjords,
                yet even more can be found in the Westman Islands. They have, in fact, become
                the signature symbol of the archipelago. Why puffins are so popular is
                little wonder to any who see them. Their colourful, charming features,
                clumsy gait when waddling on land, and the fact that they nest in lifelong
                pairs make them the dictionary-definition of cuteness. The fact they have
                little fear of people and will let visitors approach them within mere metres
                only adds to their appeal.

            <h2>GYRFALCONS</h2>
            <p>
                Gyrfalcons are apex predators of the sky, having been used in falconry for
                centuries. Found across the Arctic region, Icelandic gyrfalcons are the most
                unique of the world’s populations, with a light, uniform plumage and a reputation
                for precision hunting. For this reason, they were an important part of Icelandic
                trade with wealthy Europeans as far back as the medieval era, being one of the
                country’s most prized exports.Like the Snowy Owl, they feed largely on ptarmigans,
                but are not beneath taking other birds; they're able to take prey from the sky
                as easily as they can pluck it off the ground. They have been much more successful
                in Iceland than the owls, with a larger wild population, although still are
                not numerous; there are thought to be only about 400 breeding pairs.Due to the
                fact they nest in cliff faces, they are found most often in the Highlands,
                East Fjords, Westfjords, and mountainous parts of the North. In particular,
                they nest around Jökulsárgljúfur in the northern Vatnajökull National Park,
                a canyon that holds the most powerful waterfall in Europe, Dettifoss.

The perennial plant is native to North America and was introduced to Iceland in 1945 to tackle topsoil erosion. Since its arrival, the lupine has prospered and spread all over the country, sometimes in locations where it is not wholly welcome. In many areas, it poses a threat to a number of indigenous plants, including some moss species which are notoriously difficult to establish or recover. Worries about a lupine monoculture homogenising the natural flora of Iceland fuel anti-lupine sentiment but it has proven difficult to halt the proliferation of the species.Not everyone is against the lupine! Many take pleasure from the colour it has added to the Icelandic countryside and the pretty purple flowers provide ample photo opportunities for visitors and locals alike. <a

        class="s3"><b>DANDELION (TARAXACUM FAMILY)</b></span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Dandelions grow everywhere in Iceland and in huge abundance. These wildflowers are suited to disturbed soils which are common across Iceland.Although dandelions can be considered a family of wildflowers of which quite a few different species grow in Iceland, most Icelanders when referring to a dandelion would simply use the term 'TÃºnfÃ­fill' or simply 'FÃ­fill'.Dandelions are rich in vitamins and minerals and the whole plant is edible from flower to root. They have therefore long featured in the Icelandic diet be it as a tea or tonic or by adding the leaves to salads. The root of the plant has long been used as an invaluable coffee substitute since coffee was expensive and often in short supply. <a

        class="s3"><b>DULSE (PALMARIA PALMATA)</b></span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">The history of Iceland is deeply intertwined with the sea. Not only did the Viking settlers have to cross it to reach Iceland, but it has served as a critical source of food, not only for fish for a long while. It is a type of red seaweed which nourished Icelanders since the first settlers arrived. It was collected in vast quantities in the spring and summer, and then it was dried to stockpile or for trade. It could often be depended on as a reliable source of nutrition in winter. <a

        class="s3"><b>PUFFINS</b></span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">No article on the birds of Iceland can really begin without a mention of the Atlantic Puffin. These adorable animals are elusive across the vast majority of their range, but not in Iceland; sixty percent of the twelve million or so individualsÂ nest here, and from May to September, there are a wealth of places where they can be found with ease.Â As mentioned above, millions nest in the LÃ¡trabjarg birdwatching cliffs in the Westfjords, yet even more can be found in the Westman Islands. They have, in fact, become the signature symbol of the archipelago. Why puffins are so popular is little wonder to any who see them. Their colourful, charming features, clumsy gait when waddling on land, and the fact that they nest in lifelong pairs make them the dictionary-definition of cuteness. The fact they have little fear of people and will let visitors approach them within mere metres only adds to their appeal. <a

        class="s3"><b>GYRFALCONS</b></span></h2>
<p class="p5"><span class="s3">Gyrfalcons are apex predators of the sky, having been used in falconry for centuries. Found across the Arctic region, Icelandic gyrfalcons are the most unique of the worldâ€™s populations, with a light, uniform plumage and a reputation for precision hunting. For this reason, they were an important part of Icelandic trade with wealthy Europeans as far back as the medieval era, being one of the countryâ€™s most prized exports.Like the Snowy Owl, they feed largely on ptarmigans, but are not beneath taking other birds; they're able to take prey from the sky as easily as they can pluck it off the ground. They have been much more successful in Iceland than the owls, with a larger wild population, although still are not numerous; there are thought to be only about 400 breeding pairs.Due to the fact they nest in cliff faces, they are found most often in the Highlands, East Fjords, Westfjords, and mountainous parts of the North. In particular, they nest around JÃ¶kulsÃ¡rgljÃºfur in the northern VatnajÃ¶kull National Park, a canyon that holds the most powerful waterfall in Europe, Dettifoss. <a

                <h2>WHATLES</h2>
                <p>
                    Iceland’s fertile sub-Arctic waters, fed by the Gulf Stream, 
                    are home to over twenty different species of whale and dolphin. 
                    It is one of the best places in the world for whale-watching, 
                    especially during the summer when the great whales migrate here 
                    to feed. This industry is changing the way that Icelanders view 
                    the creatures of the deep, as the relationship between the two 
                    is historical and complex. As seafarers, many accounts from early 
                    Icelanders depict whales as terrible leviathans. While feared 
                    when in their natural environment, however, whales were hugely 
                    appreciated when they washed up on the beaches. The meat from a 
                    single stranding could feed communities, and their oil could 
                    supply candles and lanterns to help sustain people through the 
                    dark winters. The word for ‘windfall’ in Icelandic is the same 
                    as the word for a beached whale. <a href="reference.html"><i>[REFERENCE]</i></a>

                <h2>ARCTIC FOXES</h2>
                <p>
                    Before human settlement, Arctic Foxes were the only land 
                    mammal that lived in Iceland. The Arctic Foxes in Iceland 
                    come in two colors morphs, white and blue. White foxes change 
                    their coat completely between seasons, going from snow-white 
                    in winter to a brown and white in summer. Blue foxes do not 
                    change coat, but their fur is bleached throughout summer so 
                    that they are much lighter by the arrival of winter. Both 
                    variants thicken their fur throughout the colder months, 
                    however, and lose it when the weather warms.Arctic Foxes can 
                    be found all across Iceland, but are especially concentrated 
                    in the West-fjords, most notably the remote Hornstrandir Reserve 
                    in the very north where they are protected. In this region, 
                    they are noted for being quite fearless of humans, so wildlife 
                    photographers often come for some very intimate shots.

                <h2>REINDEER</h2>
                <p>
                    Reindeer were brought over to Iceland much later than the domestic 
                    animals, in the 18th Century. Initially, they were to be farmed as 
                    they were across Scandinavia, but Icelanders never took to the practice. 
                    The population, therefore, became wild.About 3,000 reindeer now live in 
                    the country, all concentrated in the east. They are most commonly 
                    found around Snæfell, on the higher ground throughout summer and in 
                    the warmer lowlands throughout winter, but have been seen as far 
                    south as Jökulsárlón and as far north as Vopnafjörður. Those driving 
                    through or staying in the East Fjords have a reasonable chance of 
                    spotting a herd.<a href="reference.html"><i>[REFERENCE]</i></a>

                <h2>LUPINE (LUPINUS NOOTKATENSIS)</h2>
                <p>
                    There is no other plant in Iceland as controversial as the iconic Lupine.
                    The perennial plant is native to North America and was introduced to Iceland 
                    in 1945 to tackle topsoil erosion. Since its arrival, the lupine has prospered 
                    and spread all over the country, sometimes in locations where it is not 
                    wholly welcome. In many areas, it poses a threat to a number of indigenous 
                    plants, including some moss species which are notoriously difficult to establish 
                    or recover. Worries about a lupine monoculture homogenising the natural flora 
                    of Iceland fuel anti-lupine sentiment but it has proven difficult to halt the 
                    proliferation of the species.Not everyone is against the lupine! Many take 
                    pleasure from the colour it has added to the Icelandic countryside and the 
                    pretty purple flowers provide ample photo opportunities for visitors and locals alike.

                <h2>DANDELION (TARAXACUM FAMILY)</h2>
                <p>
                    Dandelions grow everywhere in Iceland and in huge abundance. These wildflowers 
                    are suited to disturbed soils which are common across Iceland.Although dandelions 
                    can be considered a family of wildflowers of which quite a few different species 
                    grow in Iceland, most Icelanders when referring to a dandelion would simply use the 
                    term 'Túnfífill' or simply 'Fífill'.Dandelions are rich in vitamins and minerals and 
                    the whole plant is edible from flower to root. They have therefore long featured in 
                    the Icelandic diet be it as a tea or tonic or by adding the leaves to salads. The 
                    root of the plant has long been used as an invaluable coffee substitute since coffee 
                    was expensive and often in short supply.

                <p>
                    The history of Iceland is deeply intertwined with the sea. Not only did the Viking 
                    settlers have to cross it to reach Iceland, but it has served as a critical source of 
                    food, not only for fish for a long while. It is a type of red seaweed which nourished 
                    Icelanders since the first settlers arrived. It was collected in vast quantities in 
                    the spring and summer, and then it was dried to stockpile or for trade. It could 
                    often be depended on as a reliable source of nutrition in winter.

                <h2>PUFFINS</h2>
                <p>
                    No article on the birds of Iceland can really begin without a mention 
                    of the Atlantic Puffin. These adorable animals are elusive across the 
                    vast majority of their range, but not in Iceland; sixty percent of the 
                    twelve million or so individuals nest here, and from May to September, 
                    there are a wealth of places where they can be found with ease. As mentioned 
                    above, millions nest in the Látrabjarg birdwatching cliffs in the Westfjords, 
                    yet even more can be found in the Westman Islands. They have, in fact, become 
                    the signature symbol of the archipelago. Why puffins are so popular is 
                    little wonder to any who see them. Their colourful, charming features, 
                    clumsy gait when waddling on land, and the fact that they nest in lifelong 
                    pairs make them the dictionary-definition of cuteness. The fact they have 
                    little fear of people and will let visitors approach them within mere metres 
                    only adds to their appeal.

                <h2>GYRFALCONS</h2>
                <p>
                    Gyrfalcons are apex predators of the sky, having been used in falconry for 
                    centuries. Found across the Arctic region, Icelandic gyrfalcons are the most 
                    unique of the world’s populations, with a light, uniform plumage and a reputation 
                    for precision hunting. For this reason, they were an important part of Icelandic 
                    trade with wealthy Europeans as far back as the medieval era, being one of the 
                    country’s most prized exports.Like the Snowy Owl, they feed largely on ptarmigans, 
                    but are not beneath taking other birds; they're able to take prey from the sky 
                    as easily as they can pluck it off the ground. They have been much more successful 
                    in Iceland than the owls, with a larger wild population, although still are 
                    not numerous; there are thought to be only about 400 breeding pairs.Due to the 
                    fact they nest in cliff faces, they are found most often in the Highlands, 
                    East Fjords, Westfjords, and mountainous parts of the North. In particular, 
                    they nest around Jökulsárgljúfur in the northern Vatnajökull National Park, 
                    a canyon that holds the most powerful waterfall in Europe, Dettifoss.

                <h2>ARCTIC FOXES</h2>
                <p>
                    Before human settlement, Arctic Foxes were the only land 
                    mammal that lived in Iceland. The Arctic Foxes in Iceland 
                    come in two colors morphs, white and blue. White foxes change 
                    their coat completely between seasons, going from snow-white 
                    in winter to a brown and white in summer. Blue foxes do not 
                    change coat, but their fur is bleached throughout summer so 
                    that they are much lighter by the arrival of winter. Both 
                    variants thicken their fur throughout the colder months, 
                    however, and lose it when the weather warms.Arctic Foxes can 
                    be found all across Iceland, but are especially concentrated 
                    in the West-fjords, most notably the remote Hornstrandir Reserve 
                    in the very north where they are protected. In this region, 
                    they are noted for being quite fearless of humans, so wildlife 
                    photographers often come for some very intimate shots.

                <h2>WHATLES</h2>
                <p>
                    Iceland’s fertile sub-Arctic waters, fed by the Gulf Stream, 
                    are home to over twenty different species of whale and dolphin. 
                    It is one of the best places in the world for whale-watching, 
                    especially during the summer when the great whales migrate here 
                    to feed. This industry is changing the way that Icelanders view 
                    the creatures of the deep, as the relationship between the two 
                    is historical and complex. As seafarers, many accounts from early 
                    Icelanders depict whales as terrible leviathans. While feared 
                    when in their natural environment, however, whales were hugely 
                    appreciated when they washed up on the beaches. The meat from a 
                    single stranding could feed communities, and their oil could 
                    supply candles and lanterns to help sustain people through the 
                    dark winters. The word for ‘windfall’ in Icelandic is the same 
                    as the word for a beached whale. <a href="about.html"><i>[REFERENCE]</i></a>

                <h2>REINDEER</h2>
                <p>
                    Reindeer were brought over to Iceland much later than the domestic 
                    animals, in the 18th Century. Initially, they were to be farmed as 
                    they were across Scandinavia, but Icelanders never took to the practice. 
                    The population, therefore, became wild.About 3,000 reindeer now live in 
                    the country, all concentrated in the east. They are most commonly 
                    found around Snæfell, on the higher ground throughout summer and in 
                    the warmer lowlands throughout winter, but have been seen as far 
                    south as Jökulsárlón and as far north as Vopnafjörður. Those driving 
                    through or staying in the East Fjords have a reasonable chance of 
                    spotting a herd.<a href="about.html"><i>[REFERENCE]</i></a>

                <h2>RODENT & Mink</h2>
                <p>
                    Whenever humans, throughout history, discovered and settled new lands, 
                    they brought rodents with them, and Iceland is no exception. Brown rats, 
                    as well as wood and house mice, came over either with early settlers or 
                    later with trading ships, and formed populations. The rats primarily live 
                    in populated areas, while the mice have spread all across the country.
                    Iceland also has a population of wild mink, which was established more 
                    recently. They were imported for use in fur farms throughout the early 
                    20th Century, but escaped and became wild. Now, they are often spotted 
                    fishing in the waterways around Reykjavík, hunting for bird-eggs along 
                    nesting cliffs, and have become the bane of chicken farmers across the country.

                <h2>LUPINE (LUPINUS NOOTKATENSIS)</h2>
                <p>
                    There is no other plant in Iceland as controversial as the iconic Lupine.
                    The perennial plant is native to North America and was introduced to Iceland 
                    in 1945 to tackle topsoil erosion. Since its arrival, the lupine has prospered 
                    and spread all over the country, sometimes in locations where it is not 
                    wholly welcome. In many areas, it poses a threat to a number of indigenous 
                    plants, including some moss species which are notoriously difficult to establish 
                    or recover. Worries about a lupine monoculture homogenising the natural flora 
                    of Iceland fuel anti-lupine sentiment but it has proven difficult to halt the 
                    proliferation of the species.Not everyone is against the lupine! Many take 
                    pleasure from the colour it has added to the Icelandic countryside and the 
                    pretty purple flowers provide ample photo opportunities for visitors and locals alike.

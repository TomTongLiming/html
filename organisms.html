                <h2>WHALES</h2>
                <p>
                    There are over twenty different species of whale and dolphin in Iceland’s sub-Arctic water. 
                    It is one of the best places in the world to watch whale, especially during the summer which 
                    is time for the whale to migrate here for feeding. A long time before, residents of Iceland 
                    thought that whales are terrible monsters in the sea. However, the stranding of the whale 
                    can bring a lot of benefits for local residents. The meat from a single stranding could feed 
                    communities, and the oil could supply candles and lanterns to help sustain people during winter.

                <h2>ARCTIC FOXES</h2>
                <p>
                    Arctic Foxes were the only land mammal that lived in Iceland before humans 
                    arrived in Iceland. There are two kinds of colors of arctic foxes, white 
                    and blue. White fox will their fur because of the change of seasons. Their 
                    furs are snow-white in winter and they become brown and white in summer. 
                    Blue foxes do not change the color of fur, but they will bleach their fur. 
                    Arctic foxes can be easy to find on Iceland, especially in the west-fjords.

                <h2>REINDEER</h2>
                <p>
                    Reindeer are not the domestic animal in Iceland, and they were brought 
                    to Iceland in the 18th Century. Reindeers are wild in Iceland because 
                    they were not be farmed. Nowadays, there are about 3,000 reindeer live in 
                    Iceland, and all concentrated in the east.

                <p>
                    The perennial plant is from North America originally and then it was introduced to 
                    Iceland in 1945 to tackle topsoil erosion. Although Lupine covers almost everywhere 
                    in Iceland and brings color and beautiful views for Iceland, it forces a number of 
                    indigenous plants, including some moss species which are notoriously difficult to 
                    establish or recover. However, it is difficult for people to stop the proliferation 
                    of lupine.

                <p>
                    Dandelions can be seen everywhere in Iceland, so it is in huge abundance. Dandelion, 
                    which is known as a wildflower, is suited to disturbed soils that are common across 
                    Iceland. Most Icelanders would like to call dandelion as the term 'Túnfífill' or 
                    simply 'Fífill'. Dandelions contain a fund of vitamins and minerals, and the whole 
                    plant is edible from flower to root.

                <p>
                    Long time ago, Viking settlers use dulse to cross the ocean to reach Iceland. 
                    Dulses are not only used in sailing but also served as a critical source of 
                    food for fish for a long while. It is a type of red seaweed which was as the 
                    food for Icelanders since the first settlers arrived. It was collected in the 
                    spring and summer, and then it was dried to store or for trade. Because it has 
                    enough nutrients to support human’s normal lives, people often be depended on 
                    as a reliable source of nutrition in winter.

                <p>
                    These adorable animals are rare to see across the vast majority of their 
                    range except in Iceland. 60% of the twelve million individuals nest here. 
                    From May to September, it is a pretty time for people to find them easily. 
                    Puffins are so popular because of their colorful, charming features and clumsy 
                    gait when waddling on land. They nest in lifelong pairs which is also a specific 
                    feature. As a result, these attractive characteristics make them the symbol of cuteness.

                <h2>GYRFALCONS</h2>
                <p>
                    Gyrfalcons are predators of the sky and it has been used in falconry before. 
                    Gyrfalcons are the most unique of the world’s populations in Iceland because 
                    it has a light, uniform plumage. Precision hunting is the most conspicuous feature 
                    to make them popular and well-known. They were an important part of Icelandic trade 
                    between Europeans, and then they became one of the country’s most prized exports. 
                    Their diet is mainly ptarmigans, and they do not beneath taking other birds. It easy 
                    for them to take prey from the sky as easily as they can catch it on the ground. 
                    However, this kind of strong animal is very scarce, which there are only 400 breeding 
                    pairs on the land.
